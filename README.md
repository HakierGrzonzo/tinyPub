# tinyPub.py

A crude, prompt_toolkit based, python *.epub* reader.

It keeps track of your reading progress in a .tinyPub.json file in your home directory.

## How to use:

Just run it with your *.epub* file as an argument:

```
./tinyPub.py <path to ebook>
```

It works on linux, maybe works on windows.
