A simple, [py_cui](https://github.com/jwlodek/py_cui) based, terminal ebook reader for .epub files.

```

```

Features:

- Your cursor should be exactly where you left it, as your progress is tracked in ~/.tinypub.json file
- You can create short notes, and quickly jump to them.
- Somewhat scalable interface. I mean, it works on startupâ€¦
