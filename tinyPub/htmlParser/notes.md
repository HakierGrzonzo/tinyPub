# Style handling:

## Style priority:

1. `style` property on tag
2. linked stylesheet
3. `<style>` tag in the document
4. defaults

## Style dict fetching:

1. Generate global *dict-sheet* for entire document from defaults, `<style>` and linked stylesheet in that order.
2. Fetch style dict from *dict-sheet*; if tag has a valid `style` property, append it to style dict.
